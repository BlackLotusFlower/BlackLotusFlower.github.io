        <p>
            Our Intermediate Yoga Class is designed for those who have attended a few yoga sessions 
            and are comfortable with the basic poses. This class aims to challenge your practice 
            by introducing more complex postures, deeper stretches, and advanced breathing techniques.
            Our instructors will encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and explore your 
            physical and mental boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this class, you will work on building strength, flexibility, and balance through a 
            series of dynamic and flowing sequences. You will also learn how to connect your breath 
            with movement, enhancing your focus and mindfulness. This class is perfect for those 
            looking to deepen their practice and take their yoga journey to the next level. 
            Come prepared to sweat, have fun, and discover new possibilities within yourself.
